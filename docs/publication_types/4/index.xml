      <description>Abstract: Miyun Reservoir, the most important surface source water for Beijing, has been suffered water crisis due to continuous drought and over-extraction during recent years; the Central Route of South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) is expect to transfer water from Danjiangkou Reservoir to Miyun Reservoir in order to resolve the water shortage. The SNWDP will be bound to solve release the water crisis in the respect of “wa</description>

      <description>MIB producing potential of Planktothrix sp. The production of odorant methylisoborneol (MIB) in water bodies by Planktothrix sp. have not been understood very well. Through a four-year investigation in Miyun Reservoir, a huge mesotrophic drinking water reservoir known to have the MIB episodes, we found that the Planktothrix sp. bloomed during September and October causing the high levels of MIB in the reservoir. The concentration of MIB and the biomass of MIB-producing cyanobacteria Planktothrix sp.</description>

      <description>Rapid detection method of Anabaena associated with odorous compound based on qPCR in freshwater system: Geosmin has often been associated with off-flavor problems in drinking water with Anabaena sp. as the major producer. Rapid on-site detection of geosmin-producers as well as geosmin is important for a timely management response to potential off-flavor events. In this study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were developed to detect the levels of Anabaena sp.</description>
