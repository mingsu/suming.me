      <description>Project Information  From: State Key Program of National Natural Science of China Founding: ￥2 M Host: Min Yang Period: Jan, 2010 - Dec, 2013 Grant No.: 50938007  Abstract In recent years, cyanobacterial blooming in lakes and reservoirs is becoming more and more frequent, which has caused serious concerns regarding the drinking water safety posed by harmful algal metabolites such as odor and toxin substances. In this project, two source water reservoirs in north China (Miyun Reservoir and Yanghe Reservoir), which are in different nutrition states, were selected as the research targets, and the responding mechanisms of algae to nutrition and hydraulic conditions, as well as the physical, chemical and biological mechanisms for the production of odor-causing compounds and algal toxins were systematically studied by combining the on-site observation approaches with microcosm simulation methods.</description>
