In this study, a novel advanced oxidation process (AOP) based on plasma in gas–liquid interface discharge was investigated for removing humic acid (HA), and ozonation treatment effect was evaluated as a comparison. Several indexes including UV254, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), and excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectra were employed to characterize HA transformation. The results showed that typical species including ozone, hydrogen peroxide and HO˙ were produced in the plasma process, which made better removal efficiency than ozonation. Especially, UV254 was removed effectively by 96.5% and 90.3% within 15 min by plasma and ozonation, while DOC was 49.2% and 41.1%, respectively. HO˙ radicals were majorly responsible for the degradation of HA in the plasma process, which were mainly generated via reaction of in situ produced ozone and H2O2 during the discharge process.  UV/vis absorbance and EEM results further showed that HA with the large molecular weight fraction was decomposed to small molecular weight fraction. This study indicates that plasma technology has a significant application prospect as a replacement for ozone in drinking water industry.","tags":null,"title":"Humic acid removal by gas–liquid interface discharge plasma: performance, mechanism and comparison to ozonation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qingyuan Guo","Jianwei Yu","**Ming Su**","Chunmiao Wang","Min Yang","Nan Cao","Yu Zhao","Ping Xia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546272000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"c472cb85767ce97f00d091cc688c201f","permalink":"http://suming.me/publication/guo-2019-synergistic/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/guo-2019-synergistic/","section":"publication","summary":"Revealing the main contributors to septic odor is a challenge since diverse compounds are responsible for this odor, and there might exist synergistic effects among different odorants. In this study, based on a reconstitution evaluation, the contribution of eighteen odorants identified in Huangpu River source water to the septic odor was explored. The reconstitution test result showed that the three typical odorants, including bis(2‑chloroisopropyl) ether (BCIE), diethyl disulfide (DEDS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), with respective average odor activity values (OAVs) of 2.35, 1.65 and 0.78, only contributed 61 ± 3% of the FPA intensity for septic odor in Huangpu source water. At a BCIE concentration of 50 ng/L, synergistic effect for the septic odor occurred at 10 ng/L for geosmin and 20 ng/L for 2‑methylisoborneol (MIB), showing that coexisting musty odorants could enhance the septic odor intensity caused by some typical odorants. When both geosmin and MIB, with an average OAV of 4.54 and 1.38, were further included in addition to the three typical odorants, 88 ± 4% of the septic odor in Huangpu River source water could be explained.

The user can select the types and species composition from a predetermined list, which includes data for a comprehensive range of phytoplankton and includes all algal classes and cyanobacteria.\nCounting options include the user’s preferences of full field of view, transects, at the chosen magnification. The user is able to easily construct a list of types seen in the sample from a stored list which includes links to web-based photomicroscopy images to aid with identification.\nIn addition, the user can choose to count and record data for a range of units including single cells, filaments (trichomes) or the area for colonial types such as Microcystis. This accommodates the complexity of how to count and quantify colonial species and genera of cyanobacteria in particular.\nThe software library already includes the approximate geometric shapes for all types of cells which can then be used to automatically calculate and record biovolume for each species counted.\nIt is also possible to record and hyperlink photos taken of species and cell types from the user’s individual sample being counted for later checking and also for including in reporting.\nThe software includes the ability to record the map coordinates of the sample site and later to include a map of the sites in a report. The geolocation information is established in the database for each new site (need to include the source of data used for mapping and constructing image maps)\n Reporting The real power of the software is in the automatic generation of results which allows for production of customised reports.

This project explores the growth and odor characteristics of typical filamentous odor-producing cyanobacteria under different light conditions at different intensity level and spectrum distribution, as well as the competition with bloom forming cyanobacteria. By combining the results from lab culture studies and on-site simulation experiments, the light thresholds for restricting cyanobacterial growth was determined. Based on these results, hydraulic regulating strategy is expected to be developed to control underwater light conditions for different type of reservoirs, and a hydraulic model can be construct according to boundary conditions of targeting reservoirs. This hydraulic model can be subsequently used to simulate various scenes with different hydraulic measures and to compute the distribution of underwater light climate, which can be used to elect the best feasible hydraulic measure according to light thresholds of different strains. The research consists of light response mechanism exploration for various typical odorous filamentous cyanobacteria, and hydraulic measures development for different types of reservoirs with different turbidity level, herein two case studies for the low turbid Miyun Reservoir and high turbid Qingcaosha Reservoir will be performed for developing respective control strategies.\n","date":1532390400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"8d6c69cb9f4db51c03ec53d03fadae62","permalink":"http://suming.me/project/su2018miyunnsf/","publishdate":"2018-07-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/su2018miyunnsf/","section":"project","summary":"the National Science Foundation of China","tags":["Odor-producing cyanobacteria","Control","2-MIB","Light competition","Filamentous cyanobacteria","Odor","State Founded"],"title":"In-situ control of filamentous odor-producing cyanobacteria based on underwater light lowering technology in source water reservoirs: mechanism and strategy development","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Information  From: Shanghai urban construction investment co., LTD Founding: ￥0.277 M Host: Ming Su Period: Jul, 2018 - Jun, 2019  Project Introduction 基于2-MIB功能基因构建实时荧光定量PCR方法，用于检测水体产嗅潜力。\n","date":1532217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"76544f71c4e810d0a3940034841ad718","permalink":"http://suming.me/project/su2018molecular/","publishdate":"2018-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/su2018molecular/","section":"project","summary":"Shanghai urban construction investment co., LTD","tags":["Odor-producing cyanobacteria","Phytoplankton","Gene","Odor","non-State Founded"],"title":"2-MIB gene detection of source water reservoirs in Shanghai","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Information  From: Zhuhai Water Environment Holding Groups LTD.

In this project, two source water reservoirs in north China (Miyun Reservoir and Yanghe Reservoir), which are in different nutrition states, were selected as the research targets, and the responding mechanisms of algae to nutrition and hydraulic conditions, as well as the physical, chemical and biological mechanisms for the production of odor-causing compounds and algal toxins were systematically studied by combining the on-site observation approaches with microcosm simulation methods. By comprehensively using the methodologies of applied ecology, hydraulics, environmental chemistry and molecular biology, this project will try to elucidate the impacts of different environmental factors on the algal population dynamics and harmful algal metabolites both qualitatively and quantitatively, and establish algal ecological dynamics models. The purpose of the study is to predict the occurrence of algal blooms and the production behavior of harmful algal metabolites, and provide a scientific basis for lake and reservoir-type water source management.\n","date":1532217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"2673eeb2158f4a597d9fcadbbeff90a1","permalink":"http://suming.me/project/yang2010miyunnsf/","publishdate":"2018-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/yang2010miyunnsf/","section":"project","summary":"State Key Program of National Natural Science of China","tags":["Cyanobacterial bloom","Ecological model","Odorant","Cyanotoxin","State Founded"],"title":"Mechansim of cyanobacterial bloom and harmful by-product in source water reservoirs and lakes","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Information  From: Shanghai urban construction investment co., LTD Founding: ￥0.30 M Host: Ming Su Period: Apr, 2016 - Mar, 2018  Project Aim 围绕改善青草沙水库水动力条件、最大程度控制藻类（产嗅藻）、抑制水体富营养化、维护库区优良水质等总体需求，利用青草沙水库水动力（流速、停留时间）、环境因子（水温、浊度、光照）对藻类群落结构稳定性影响评估技术，研究青草沙水库增设水闸的优化布局方案，即提出新增水闸的闸址方案及规模并配套形成增设水闸条件下的青草沙水库的优化调度建议，为水库的长期稳定运行和科学管理提供保障。\nProject Tasks (Task III) 青草沙水库新增水闸对产嗅藻生长影响评估  数据收集整理：收集整理青草沙水库历史数据以及项目执行期间水体嗅味发生期青草沙水库常规水质、藻类及其致嗅产物调查数据；研究水力停留时间、水深、浊度等主要环境因子对藻类生长的影响，揭示影响潜在产嗅藻生长的关键因子。 典型产嗅藻生长模型培养及其产嗅潜力评估：根据青草沙水库潜在产嗅藻数据以及文献报道潜在致嗅藻种（颤藻、席藻、小席藻、浮颤藻、束丝藻、拟鱼腥藻等），选取典型产嗅藻1-3株，在实验室内模拟新增水闸后水库的环境条件，考察不同环境条件下产嗅藻的主要生长参数，并评估不同藻种的产嗅潜力及与环境因子之间的关系。 青草沙水库新增水闸后产嗅藻及致嗅物发展趋势研究：基于水力学模型输出结果，结合实验室模拟实验中得出的典型产嗅藻生长参数，评估新增水闸方案对产嗅藻类生长的影响，为新增水闸选址提供依据。  ","date":1532217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"2797d54b9e33d9a6960c51e61ffdfed7","permalink":"http://suming.me/project/su2016qcsecp/","publishdate":"2018-07-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/su2016qcsecp/","section":"project","summary":"Shanghai urban construction investment co., LTD","tags":["Odor-producing cyanobacteria","Qingcaosha","Niche","Phytoplankton","Odor","non-State Founded"],"title":"Special research of new construction of penstock in Qingcaosha Reservoir","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ming Su","Zeyu Jia","Xiaoqing Xu","Yiping Zhu","Jianwei Yu","Min Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"317d17d14eddcc1f8fce891560addf0e","permalink":"http://suming.me/post/qcs180523/","publishdate":"2018-07-22T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/qcs180523/","section":"post","summary":"针对2018年5月23日青草沙水库藻类与嗅味监测调查数据，结合历史数据展开分析与研究，有利于进一步理解、掌握青草沙水库嗅味问题。","tags":["Odor","2-MIB","Qingcaosha","Turbidity","Odor-producing cyanobacteria"],"title":"Report of Qingcaosha Reservoir regarding the investigation on May 23, 2018","type":"post"},{"authors":["Ming Su","Zeyu Jia","Yunxing Dong","Jianwei Yu","Min Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"d0382b278f6b6618f2db61af3ec37a72","permalink":"http://suming.me/post/wujiang180607/","publishdate":"2018-07-22T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/post/wujiang180607/","section":"post","summary":"基于2018年6月吴江东太湖水库藻类与嗅味监测调查数据展开东太湖区藻类与嗅味问分析与研究，有利于进一步理解、掌握东太湖区备用水源嗅味问题。","tags":["Odor","2-MIB","Wujiang","Water level","Microcystis","Odor-producing cyanobacteria"],"title":"Report of odor problem of source water reservoir in East Tai Lake in June of 2018","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Project Information  From: Beijing Water Authority\u0026rdquo;

In this study we proposed a strategy based on water level regulation for the control of odor-producing cyanobacteria in source water. Miyun Reservoir, the main surface water source for Beijing, has been suffering from 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) induced T\u0026O problems caused by deep-living *Planktothrix* sp. since 2002. The biomass of deep-living *Planktothrix* in Miyun Reservoir was found to be mainly governed by the water depth above its sediment habitat. An algorithm for water level regulation aiming to minimize the risk for T\u0026O in different types of reservoirs is proposed. The study demonstrates that risk for T\u0026O can be minimized by increasing the water level in Miyun Reservoir. The high-risk area can be reduced by about 2.91% (0.61% to 5.76%) of surface area for each meter increase in the water level, when the water level is lower than 145 m. More specifically, the water level needs to be raised to higher than 147.7 m a.s.l. from 131.0 m in order to obtain an acceptable risk level (ARL) of 10%. This management strategy to abate T\u0026O problems is simpler and cheaper to implement compared to traditional physical, chemical and biological techniques. Moreover, it has no apparent negative impact on water quality and aquatic organisms.","tags":["Planktothrix","2-methylisoborneol","Taste and odor","Drinking water","Control"],"title":"Reducing production of taste and odor by deep-living cyanobacteria in drinking water reservoirs by regulation of water level","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1483200000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"b6eedc301d676c56a0c8e307b77bdf1c","permalink":"http://suming.me/viate/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/viate/","section":"","summary":" ","tags":null,"title":"Viate","type":"page"},{"authors":["Xia Li","Jianwei Yu","Qingyuan Guo","**Ming Su**","Tingting Liu","Min Yang","Yu Zhao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451577600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"f6c538426012e03d4fc29430d9b50e22","permalink":"http://suming.me/publication/li-2016-source/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2016-source/","section":"publication","summary":"Yellow River source water has long suffered from odor problems in winter. In this study, odor characteristics, potential odorants, and algae in the source water of six cities (Lanzhou, Yinchuan, Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Dongying) along the Yellow River were determined in winter (February to March 2014). According to flavor profile analysis (FPA), moderate to strong fishy odors occurred in all cities, except for Lanzhou. At the same time, mild earthy/musty odors and septic/swampy odors were also detected. The strong fishy odor (FPA intensity, 8.5) in Yinchuan was attributed to the abnormal growth of Dinobryon (cell density, 5.7 × 104 cells/mL), while the fishy odors in Hohhot, Zhengzhou, Jinan, and Dongying might be caused by Melosira and Cyclotella, Cryptomonas, Dinobryon, and Synedra, respectively. Unsaturated aldehydes, which have been reported to cause fishy odors, were not detected in all samples. However, some saturated aldehydes, including hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, decanal, and benzaldehyde, were detected with a total concentration range of 690 ng/L to 2166 ng/L, and might have partly contributed to the fishy odors. In addition, 2-MIB (5.77–21.12 ng/L) and geosmin (2.26–9.73 ng/L) were responsible for the earthy/musty odors in the Yellow River source waters, and dimethyl disulfide (648.2 ng/L) was responsible for the rancid/swampy odor (FPA intensity, 8.0) episode in Yinchuan. This is a comprehensive study reporting on the occurrence and possible reasons for the odor issues in the Yellow River source water during winter.","tags":["Taste and odor","Fishy odor","Drinking water","GC×GC-TOFMS","Yellow River"],"title":"Source-water odor during winter in the Yellow River area of China: Occurrence and diagnosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R"],"content":" R Markdown This is an R Markdown document.

The production of odorant methylisoborneol (MIB) in water bodies by Planktothrix sp. have not been understood very well. Through a four-year investigation in Miyun Reservoir, a huge mesotrophic drinking water reservoir known to have the MIB episodes, we found that the Planktothrix sp. bloomed during September and October causing the high levels of MIB in the reservoir. The concentration of MIB and the biomass of MIB-producing cyanobacteria Planktothrix sp. were measured (n=887) at different sites and depths during different seasons. The results indicated that the shallow region of the reservoir is the major habitat for Planktothrix sp. due to that the light is able to penetrate down to the relatively high concentrations of nutrients close to the sediments. Quantile regression analysis between Planktothrix sp. biomass and MIB concentration shows that the risk of MIB exceeding the odor threshold (15 ng L⁻¹) in water was as high as 90 % when the Planktothrix sp. density was more than 4.0 × 10⁵ cells L⁻¹, while the risk was reduced to 10 % when the Planktothrix sp. density remained below 1.6 × 10⁴ cells L⁻¹. This study will improve the understanding of the environmental behaviors of Planktothrix sp., and can provide useful information for better management of drinking water lakes/reservoirs experiencing the taste and odor (T\u0026amp;O) problems caused by deep living cyanobacterial species.\nNiche identi􏰀ication of Planktothrix sp. Water quality problems caused by harmful algae in drinking water reservoir have raised great concerns. According to a four-years investigation in Miyun Reservoir through 2009 to 2012, the prediction of odor-producing Planktothrix sp. were performed based on the ecological niche theory and redundancy analysis, in case of that the reservoir accepts water with increasing TN-loading from Danjiangkou Reservoir through South-to-North Water Diversion Project in China this year. The result shows insolation and TN are the two key variables in the niche space for Planktothrix sp. and Microcystis sp., the dominate species in summer. In insolation-TN plane, the orbit of aquatic environment cross over the niche space of Planktothrix and Microcystis chronologically in Miyun Reservoir. In addition, the growth potential of the odor-producing Planktothrix sp. will probably increase after the water from Danjiangkou Reservoir 􏰀low into Miyun Reservoir according to the simulation result. This study is helpful for the understanding of algal competition and succession based on the ecological niche theory, and can provide an important tool to assess the risk of T\u0026amp;O problem therefore conducting the source water management.\nRegulation and control of Planktothrix sp. The control and management of harmful algae bloom in source water is critical to drinking water safety, especially for the algal toxins and taste \u0026amp; odor issues. Due to traditional solutions of controlling algae were mainly based on physical or chemical mechanisms, they were greatly limited by their disadvantages including high energy consuming or toxic to other aquatic organisms. According the previous result, the niche space of Planktothrix sp. has been determined, and the key factors governing its growth were identified as the light availability and nutrient concentration in water. It implies the water depth is a comprehensive factor: low water depth have high risk. According to this result, the high risk zone of suffering T\u0026amp;O problem has been determined. By performing the GIS based technology, the dynamic changes of high risk zone were simulated under different water level, and the recommend water level of Miyun Reservoir were determined aiming to minimize the T\u0026amp;O risk. The result showed that the risk (less than 10 %) of suffering T\u0026amp;O problem can be signi􏰀icant reduced if the water level rising to 147.7 m a.s.l. in Miyun Reservoir. In addition, the application of water level strategy were discussed for different types of reservoirs/lakes. This strategy can be applied combined with the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and could be a possible solution for the T\u0026amp;O problem in Miyun Reservoir.\n","date":1433088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"ad65c408bee854072e702f9251467925","permalink":"http://suming.me/publication/su2015study/","publishdate":"2015-06-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/su2015study/","section":"publication","summary":"As the most important surface water source for Beijing, Miyun Reservoir has been suffered from taste \u0026 odor (T\u0026O) problem since 2003, which has been a serious threat to the drinking water safety of Beijing.

Through a four-year investigation in Miyun Reservoir, a huge mesotrophic drinking water reservoir known to have the MIB episodes, we found that the *Planktothrix* sp. bloomed during September and October causing the high levels of MIB in the reservoir. The concentration of MIB and the biomass of MIB-producing cyanobacteria *Planktothrix* were measured (n = 887) at different sites and depths during different seasons. The results indicated that the shallow region of the reservoir is the major habitat for *Planktothrix* sp. due to that the light is able to penetrate down to the relatively high concentrations of nutrients close to the sediments. Quantile regression analysis between *Planktothrix* biomass and MIB concentration shows that the risk of MIB exceeding the odor threshold (15 ng L⁻¹) in water was as high as 90% when the *Planktothrix* density was more than 4.0 × 10⁵ cells L⁻¹, while the risk was reduced to 10% when the *Planktothrix* density remained below 1.6 × 10⁴ cells L⁻¹. This study will improve the understanding of the environmental behaviors of *Planktothrix* sp., and can provide useful information for better management of drinking water lakes/reservoirs experiencing the taste and odor (T\u0026O) problems caused by deep living cyanobacterial species.","tags":["planktothrix","2-mib","taste and odor","drinking water","low irradiance specialist cyanobacteria"],"title":"MIB-producing cyanobacteria (Planktothrix sp.) in a drinking water reservoir: Distribution and odor producing potential","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianwei Yu","Juan Liu","Wei An","Yongjing Wang","Junzhi Zhang","Wei Wei","**Ming Su**","Min Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"13041d5af36aec677e0af2b99734b324","permalink":"http://suming.me/publication/yu-2015-multiple/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/yu-2015-multiple/","section":"publication","summary":"A total of 86 source water samples from 38 cities across major watersheds of China were collected for a bromide (Br−) survey, and the bromate (BrO3−) formation potentials (BFPs) of 41 samples with Br− concentration 20 $μ$g L−1 were evaluated using a batch ozonation reactor. Statistical analyses indicated that higher alkalinity, hardness, and pH of water samples could lead to higher BFPs, with alkalinity as the most important factor. Based on the survey data, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model including three parameters (alkalinity, ozone dose, and total organic carbon (TOC)) was established with a relatively good prediction performance (model selection criterionþinspace=þinspace2.01, R2þinspace=þinspace0.724), using logarithmic transformation of the variables. Furthermore, a contour plot was used to interpret the influence of alkalinity and TOC on BrO3− formation with prediction accuracy as high as 71 %, suggesting that these two parameters, apart from ozone dosage, were the most important ones affecting the BFPs of source waters with Br− concentration 20 $μ$g L−1.

I was using gcalcli for couple years, however, it is become very difficult to use in mainland China, due to the GFW policy; on the other hand, I prefer to using my own server other than using the server from others, in this case google calendar.\nSo I start to find a better solution. Fortunately, I managed it by using remind, wyrd, conky and rem2html.\n Screenshot Screen shot of my schedule based on remind and conky \n remind Plain text is the most portable, munge-able, searchable, dependable, and software-agnostic file format there is. We’ve covered how to track your tasks and projects in a todo.txt file; today we’re going to extend our plain text personal information manager to include a full-on calendar, using an old school UNIX program called Remind.\nRemind is really a powerful tool to schedule your time. I am not going to the detail for the usage of Remind, you might go to the shell, and type:\n$man remind For example, you can shedule a date with your GF/BF like this:\nREM 2014/12/24 MSG Dating this evening with honey. Or you can check your salary on the first day of each month:\nREM 1 MSG Checking salary. Or have a meething:\nREM 2014/11/25 AT 9:00 MSG Meeting now  wyrd Screenshot of wyrd\nRemind is very powerful but not handy enough, as you have to remeber lots of commands. If you use it in a very simple way, just like me, wyrd is a good choice.\nSpeaking of regularly using - wyrd will be used just as much as Remind. In addition to the easy to navigate display of events it also has a fully-configurable set of hotkeys that, for the little that I’ve used them, seem to work a lot like Vim. There happen to be two things that I like best about wyrd right from the start. The first is the fact that it’s written in OCaml. The second is that the developer took the time to make a well-orchestrated SWF file that walks through some sample uses. It just warms my little heart to see a developer caring about their users. ;-)\nFor me, the most fantastic usage of wyrd is its quick_event function, similar to gcalcli.\nYou could use it in a smart way, like this:\nwyrd --add \u0026#39;Have dinner with John Fri 6pm.\u0026#39; wyrd --add \u0026#39;Tomorrow 7:30am prepare breakfast.\u0026#39; and also there are a lot more handy short cut for using Remind by wyrd.\n conky You can also add such line in your conkyrc script, then you will get a week scale schedule calendar on your desktop.\n${execi 300 remind -c+1 -n ~/.reminders} In addition, you can get a schedule summary in text style by adding this line to your conkyrc file:\n${execi 300 remind -n ~/.reminders | sort}  rem2html Sometimes, you might want to public your calendar on your blog, you can use rem2html for generating a static web calendar.\nYou can have a look at mine via: My calendar\nUsage:\nremind -ps12 /home/ming/.reminders | sed \u0026#39;s/^\\(.*:.*:.*m\\) .*$/\\1 BUSY/g\u0026#39; | /home/ming/bin/rem2html --title \u0026quot;ming\u0026#39;s calendar\u0026quot;\u0026gt; /var/www/cal/index.html The sed command here is aiming to replace your schedule detail to BUSY.\n-ps12 means you will publish the following 12 month calendar to the web page.\n reminding text message to your cell phone You might able to find some particular method to send text message from shell to your cell phone.\nHere are some hint:\nHow to Send SMS Using Email to Major US Cellphone Carriers if you are a china telecom user, you can use their free service indirectly: i setup your china telecom email address; i setup the email system text to you in its setup; i send a reminder email to your china telecom email address by using mutt, then your cell phone will receive a text message. if you are a china mobile user, you can txet to your cell phone from use some shell-drived-fetion on your system; one of the well maintained one is FetionRobot   email and desktop reminder You can also send email to you for remindering, I believe there are many ways to do this.

Using the two qPCR protocols, we succeeded in measuring different levels of ARG and GSG copies in different freshwater systems with high incidence environmental substrata and diverse ecological condi- tions, showing that the methods developed could be applied for environmental monitoring. Moreover, comparing to the microscopic count and GC–MS analytical methods, the qPCR methods can reduce the time-to-results from several days to a few hours and require considerably less traditional algal identification and taxonomic expertise.\n Spatial and temporal variations of algal populations associated with odorous compounds in drinking water reservoirs: Spatial variations in phytoplankton community within a large mesotrophic reservoir (Miyun Reservoir, North China) was investigated in relation to variations in physico-chemical properties, nutrient concentrations, temperature and light conditions over a 5 months period in\n The dynamics of phytoplankton community was represented by the dominance of cyanobacteria through summer and fall, following with a short term dominance of chlorophyta in late fall, and a relatively high abundance of diatom in October; on the other hand, maximum phytoplankton biomass was recorded in the north shallow region of Miyun Reservoir with a higher nutrients level. Particular attention was paid to the impacts of environmental conditions on the growth of two cyanobacteria genera, the toxin producing Microcystis and the taste \u0026amp; odor producing Oscillatoria. Microcystis biomass was in general greatly affected by water temperature and mixing depth/local water depth ($z{mix}$/$z{max}$) ratio in this reservoir, while the Oscillatoria biomass in the surface and middle layers was greatly affected by TDP, and that in the bottom layer was related with the secchi depth/local water depth (SD/zmax) ratio.

A study of phytoplankton community succession: cell morphologic response to natural light availability: This study attempted to reveal the effect of solar radiation fluctuation on the dynamics of phytoplankton communities expressed as cell morphology in enclosed water bodies with sufficient nutrients. A model was established to describe the responses of phytoplankton morphology to natural light availability with underwater climate and mixing process in the water column considered. Based on the data collected from the eutrophicated Yanghe Reservoir, the model was derived as $V = 37.92\\lambda$ $\\varphip$ ($r^2 = 0.673$, p \u0026lt; 0.01), where $\\lambda$ is a function of solar elevation angle (θ) and mixing/euphotic depth ratio ($z{mix}/z_{eu}) in water, and $\\varphi_p$ (cellular projected area) could reflect the cell’s light-harvesting potential. Post analysis of the model results revealed that species with large φp and flattening index (f, obtained by model results and could reflect the cell’s energy requirement) in general have advantages in spring and winter when underwater light availability is low; by contrast, those with small $\\varphi_p$ and f have advantages in summer. Such variations are mainly due to the cell’s energy balance: larger $\\varphi_p$ and f meaning that the cells could harvest more light energy and consumed less, allowing them to be selected under low light availability; and vice versa. We thus concluded that the driver of phytoplankton community succession may be the seasonal fluctuation of solar radiation in eutrophicated water bodies.\n  ","date":1370016000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548740053,"objectID":"44b3c056f4bb45c77fefc7fdfcd83862","permalink":"http://suming.me/publication/su2013algal/","publishdate":"2013-06-01T00:00:00+08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/su2013algal/","section":"publication","summary":"After the water flow into the reservoir from the river, as the hydrology characteristic changes, including water resitence time increasing, water transparecny increasing etc., the reservoir will facillate algal growth; at the same time, the water quality problems become a threaten to dringking water safety, such as algal bloom as well as taste\u0026odor compounds produced by cyanobacteria.
