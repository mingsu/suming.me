summary: "The solution for Google searching in mainland China"
---

I have recently found a good solution for searching with google.

It is not based on **vpn** nor **host** file.

Just simply use

[http://www.gfsoso.com](http://www.gfsoso.com)

for **google** main sites

and use

[http://www.gfsoso.com/scholar](http://www.gfsoso.com/scholar)

for **google scholar**,

and so on.

Good luck!
