How do you schedule your time?
-----------------

I was using **[gcalcli](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli)** for
couple years, however, it is become very difficult to use in
mainland China, due to the **GFW** policy; on the other hand, I
prefer to using my own server other than using the server from
others, in this case **google calendar**.

So I start to find a better solution. Fortunately, I managed it
by using
**[remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind)**,
**[wyrd](http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/)**,
**[conky](http://conky.sourceforge.net/)** and
**[rem2html](https://github.com/SwissKid/rem2html)**.

remind
---------------

Plain text is the most portable, munge-able, searchable,
dependable, and software-agnostic file format there is. We've
covered how to track your tasks and projects in a todo.txt file;
today we're going to extend our plain text personal information
manager to include a full-on calendar, using an old school UNIX
program called
**[Remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind)**.


**[Remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind)** is
really a powerful tool to schedule your time.
I am not going to the detail for the usage of 
**[Remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind)**, you
might go to the shell, and type:

```
$man remind
```

For example, you can shedule a date with your GF/BF like this:

```
REM 2014/12/24 MSG Dating this evening with honey.
```

Or you can check your salary on the first day of each month:

```
REM 1 MSG Checking salary.
```

Or have a meething:

```
REM 2014/11/25 AT 9:00 MSG Meeting now
```


wyrd
------------

**[Remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind)** is
very powerful but not handy enough, as you have to remeber lots
of commands. If you use it in a very simple way, just like
me, 
**[wyrd](http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/)** is a good
choice. 

 Speaking of regularly using - 
**[wyrd](http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/)** 
will be used just as much as
**[Remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind)**. In
addition to the easy to navigate display of events it
 also has a fully-configurable set of hotkeys that, for the
 little that I've used them, seem to work a lot like Vim. There
 happen to be two things that I like best about 
**[wyrd](http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/)** 
 right from the start. The first is the fact that it's written in
 OCaml. The second is that the developer took the time to make a
 well-orchestrated SWF file that walks through some sample uses.
 It just warms my little heart to see a developer caring about
 their users. ;-) 

For me, the most fantastic usage of 
**[wyrd](http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/)** is its
quick_event function, similar to 
**[gcalcli](https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli)**.

You could use it in a smart way, like this:

```
wyrd --add 'Have dinner with John Fri 6pm.'
wyrd --add 'Tomorrow 7:30am prepare breakfast.'
```

and also there are a lot more handy short cut for using 
**[Remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind)**
by 
**[wyrd](http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/)**.

conky
------------------

You can also add such line in your **conkyrc** script, then you
will get a week scale schedule calendar on your desktop.

```
${execi 300 remind -c+1 -n ~/.reminders}
```

In addition, you can get a schedule summary in text style by
adding this line to your **conkyrc** file:

```
${execi 300 remind -n ~/.reminders | sort}
```

rem2html
----------------

Sometimes, you might want to public your calendar on your blog,
you can use 
**[rem2html](https://github.com/SwissKid/rem2html)** for
generating a static web calendar.

You can have a look at mine via:
[My calendar](/cal/)

Usage:

```
remind -ps12 /home/ming/.reminders | sed 's/^\(.*:.*:.*m\) .*$/\1 BUSY/g' | /home/ming/bin/rem2html --title "ming's calendar"> /var/www/cal/index.html
```


The **sed** command here is aiming to replace your schedule
detail to **BUSY**.

**-ps12** means you will publish the following 12 month calendar
to the web page.

### *text message* to your cell phone

You might able to find some particular method to send text
message from shell to your cell phone.

Here are some hint:

1. [How to Send SMS Using Email to Major US Cellphone
   Carriers](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/sms-using-email/)
2. if you are a china telecom user, you can use their free
   service indirectly: 
        i setup your china telecom email address;
        i setup the email system text to you in its setup;
        i send a reminder email to your china telecom email
          address by using **[mutt](http://www.mutt.org)**, then
          your cell phone will receive a text message.
3. if you are a china mobile user, you can txet to your cell
   phone from use some shell-drived-fetion on your system; one of
   the well maintained one is
   **[FetionRobot](http://www.it-adv.net)**

### email and desktop reminder

You can also send email to you for remindering, I believe there
are many ways to do this. In my case, I using
**[mutt](http://www.mutt.org)** for email.

The basic usage of **[mutt](http://www.mutt.org)**:

```
echo email body | mutt -s subject send-to-email-address
```

Combined with 
**[remind](http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind)**

You might also want to get a desktop reminder by **gxmessage**,
you can install it by (debian like system):

```
apt-get install gxmessage
```

And you can start **remind** server and enable both **gxmessage**
reminder and **mail** reminder by using:

```
$remind -z -k'gxmessage -title "reminder" -center %s && echo %s | mutt -s %s YOUREMAILADRESSn &' ~/.reminders &
```

You can also add this to your **.xinitrc** file.
