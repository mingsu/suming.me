## Abstract

Miyun Reservoir, the most important surface source water for
Beijing, has been suffered water crisis due to continuous drought
and over-extraction during recent years; the Central Route of
South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP) is expect to
transfer water from Danjiangkou Reservoir to Miyun Reservoir in
order to resolve the water shortage. The SNWDP will be bound to
solve release the water crisis in the respect of “water quantity”
, however, the “water quality” should also be guaranteed. This
project is aiming to assess the impact of the SNWDP on the water
quality of Miyun Reservoir, in a view of taste & odor problem in
drinking water – a long term problem in Miyun Reservoir; the
laboratory simulation, field monitoring as well as model
computation were performed in this project to evaluate the impact
from SNWDP on the water environment, including the mixing effect
between south water and reservoir water, the water environmental
changes caused by the water level increase as well as the
invasion of external algal species from south water. Based on
these results, the environmental parameters of Miyun Reservoir
were determined according to the model simulation, and the growth
potential of Planktothrix sp. and the trend of taste & odor
problem in Miyun Reservoir were evaluated according to ecological
niche theory; this project will assess the water quality of Miyun
Reservoir after the execution of SNWDP, and is believed to be
helpful for scientific policy adoption and effective strategies
exploration.
