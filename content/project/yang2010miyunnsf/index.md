## Abstract

In recent years, cyanobacterial blooming in lakes and reservoirs is becoming
more and more frequent, which has caused serious concerns regarding the
drinking water safety posed by harmful algal metabolites such as odor and toxin
substances. In this project, two source water reservoirs in north China (Miyun
Reservoir and Yanghe Reservoir), which are in different nutrition states, were
selected as the research targets, and the responding mechanisms of algae to
nutrition and hydraulic conditions, as well as the physical, chemical and
biological mechanisms for the production of odor-causing compounds and algal
toxins were systematically studied by combining the on-site observation
approaches with microcosm simulation methods. By comprehensively using the
methodologies of applied ecology, hydraulics, environmental chemistry and
molecular biology, this project will try to elucidate the impacts of different
environmental factors on the algal population dynamics and harmful algal
metabolites both qualitatively and quantitatively, and establish algal
ecological dynamics models. The purpose of the study is to predict the
occurrence of algal blooms and the production behavior of harmful algal
metabolites, and provide a scientific basis for lake and reservoir-type water
source management.
