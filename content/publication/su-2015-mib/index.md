abstract = "The production of odorant 2-methylisoborneol (MIB) in water bodies by *Planktothrix* sp. have not been understood very well. Through a four-year investigation in Miyun Reservoir, a huge mesotrophic drinking water reservoir known to have the MIB episodes, we found that the *Planktothrix* sp. bloomed during September and October causing the high levels of MIB in the reservoir. The concentration of MIB and the biomass of MIB-producing cyanobacteria *Planktothrix* were measured (n = 887) at different sites and depths during different seasons. The results indicated that the shallow region of the reservoir is the major habitat for *Planktothrix* sp. due to that the light is able to penetrate down to the relatively high concentrations of nutrients close to the sediments. Quantile regression analysis between *Planktothrix* biomass and MIB concentration shows that the risk of MIB exceeding the odor threshold (15 ng L⁻¹) in water was as high as 90% when the *Planktothrix* density was more than 4.0 × 10⁵ cells L⁻¹, while the risk was reduced to 10% when the *Planktothrix* density remained below 1.6 × 10⁴ cells L⁻¹. This study will improve the understanding of the environmental behaviors of *Planktothrix* sp., and can provide useful information for better management of drinking water lakes/reservoirs experiencing the taste and odor (T&O) problems caused by deep living cyanobacterial species."

## Highlights

- Water level lowering triggered the deep living cyanobacteria bloom in Miyun Reservoir.
- The shallow areas in Miyun Reservoir are the major habitats for *Planktothrix* sp.
- The *Planktothrix* could bloom in mesotrophic water due to its low light requirement.
