abstract = "After the water flow into the reservoir from the river, as the hydrology characteristic changes, including water resitence time increasing, water transparecny increasing etc., the reservoir will facillate algal growth; at the same time, the water quality problems become a threaten to dringking water safety, such as algal bloom as well as taste&odor compounds produced by cyanobacteria. In the present study, long term investigation on water quality and phytoplankton community was performed in two important source water—Miyun Reservoir and Yanghe Reservoir; according to the data collected, the seasonal and spatial dynamic distributions of phytoplankton community were analized; moreover, the competetion and succession of two harmful cyanobacteria—*Microcystis* sp. and *Oscillatoria* sp. associated with taste&odor problem in Miyun Reservoir was discussed; additionally, a model describing the mechamism of light shaping on algal cells under light-limitted condition was constructed."

Rapid detection method of *Anabaena* associated with odorous
compound based on qPCR in freshwater system: Geosmin has often
been associated with off-flavor problems in drinking water with
*Anabaena* sp. as the major producer. Rapid on-site detection of
geosmin-producers as well as geosmin is important for a timely
management response to potential off-flavor events. In this
study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) methods were
developed to detect the levels of *Anabaena* sp. and geosmin,
respectively, by designing two PCR primer sets to quantify the
rpoC1 gene (ARG) and geosmin synthase one (GSG) in *Anabaena* sp.
in freshwater systems. The ARG density determined by qPCR assay
is highly related to microscopic cell count ($r^2 = 0.726$, p <
0.001), and the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of
quantification (LOQ) of the qPCR method were 0.02 pg and 0.2 pg
of DNA, respectively. At the same time，the relationship between
geosmin concentrations measured by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) and GSG copies was also established ($r^2 =
0.742$, p < 0.001) with similar LOD and LOQ values. Using the two
qPCR protocols, we succeeded in measuring different levels of
ARG and GSG copies in different freshwater systems with high
incidence environmental substrata and diverse ecological condi-
tions, showing that the methods developed could be applied for
environmental monitoring. Moreover, comparing to the
microscopic count and GC–MS analytical methods, the qPCR methods
can reduce the time-to-results from several days to a few hours
and require considerably less traditional algal identification
and taxonomic expertise.

2. Spatial and temporal variations of algal populations
   associated with odorous compounds in drinking water
   reservoirs: Spatial variations in phytoplankton community
   within a large mesotrophic reservoir (Miyun Reservoir, North
   China) was investigated in relation to variations in
   physico-chemical properties, nutrient concentrations,
   temperature and light conditions over a 5 months period in
   2009. The dynamics of phytoplankton community was represented
         by the dominance of cyanobacteria through summer and
         fall, following with a short term dominance of
         chlorophyta in late fall, and a relatively high
         abundance of diatom in October; on the other hand,
         maximum phytoplankton biomass was recorded in the north
         shallow region of Miyun Reservoir with a higher
         nutrients level. Particular attention was paid to the
         impacts of environmental conditions on the growth of two
         cyanobacteria genera, the toxin producing *Microcystis*
         and the taste & odor producing *Oscillatoria*.
         *Microcystis* biomass was in general greatly affected by
         water temperature and mixing depth/local water depth
         ($z_{mix}$/$z_{max}$) ratio in this reservoir, while the
         *Oscillatoria* biomass in the surface and middle layers
         was greatly affected by TDP, and that in the bottom
         layer was related with the secchi depth/local water
         depth (SD/zmax) ratio. Abundant *Oscillatoria* biomass
         was observed only in late September when *Microcystis*
         biomass decreased and allowed sufficient light went
         through.

3. A study of phytoplankton community succession: cell
   morphologic response to natural light availability: This study
   attempted to reveal the effect of solar radiation fluctuation
   on the dynamics of phytoplankton communities expressed as cell
   morphology in enclosed water bodies with sufficient nutrients.
   A model was established to describe the responses of
   phytoplankton morphology to natural light availability with
   underwater climate and mixing process in the water column
   considered. Based on the data collected from the eutrophicated
   Yanghe Reservoir, the model was derived as $V = 37.92\lambda$
   $\varphi_p$ ($r^2 = 0.673$, p < 0.01), where $\lambda$ is a
   function of solar elevation angle (θ) and mixing/euphotic
   depth ratio ($z_{mix}/z_{eu}) in water, and $\varphi_p$
   (cellular projected area) could reflect the cell’s
   light-harvesting potential. Post analysis of the model results
   revealed that species with large φp and flattening index (f,
   obtained by model results and could reflect the cell’s energy
   requirement) in general have advantages in spring and winter
   when underwater light availability is low; by contrast, those
   with small $\varphi_p$ and f have advantages in summer. Such
   variations are mainly due to the cell’s energy balance: larger
   $\varphi_p$ and f meaning that the cells could harvest more
   light energy and consumed less, allowing them to be selected
   under low light availability; and vice versa. We thus
   concluded that the driver of phytoplankton community
   succession may be the seasonal fluctuation of solar radiation
   in eutrophicated water bodies.
