## MIB producing potential of *Planktothrix* sp.

The production of odorant methylisoborneol (MIB) in water
bodies by *Planktothrix* sp. have not been understood very well.
Through a four-year investigation in Miyun Reservoir, a huge
mesotrophic drinking water reservoir known to have the MIB
episodes, we found that the *Planktothrix* sp. bloomed during
September and October causing the high levels of MIB in the
reservoir. The concentration of MIB and the biomass of
MIB-producing cyanobacteria *Planktothrix* sp. were measured
(n=887) at different sites and depths during different seasons.
The results indicated that the shallow region of the reservoir is
the major habitat for *Planktothrix* sp. due to that the light is
able to penetrate down to the relatively high concentrations of
nutrients close to the sediments. Quantile regression analysis
between *Planktothrix* sp. biomass and MIB concentration shows that
the risk of MIB exceeding the odor threshold (15 ng L⁻¹) in water
was as high as 90 % when the *Planktothrix* sp. density was more
than 4.0 × 10⁵ cells L⁻¹, while the risk was reduced to 10 % when
the *Planktothrix* sp. density remained below 1.6 × 10⁴ cells L⁻¹.
This study will improve the understanding of the environmental
behaviors of *Planktothrix* sp., and can provide useful information
for better management of drinking water lakes/reservoirs
experiencing the taste and odor (T&O) problems caused by deep
living cyanobacterial species.



## Niche identi􏰀ication of *Planktothrix* sp.

Water quality problems caused by harmful algae in drinking
water reservoir have raised great concerns. According to a
four-years investigation in Miyun Reservoir through 2009 to 2012,
the prediction of odor-producing *Planktothrix* sp. were performed
based on the ecological niche theory and redundancy analysis, in
case of that the reservoir accepts water with increasing
TN-loading from Danjiangkou Reservoir through South-to-North
Water Diversion Project in China this year. The result shows
insolation and TN are the two key variables in the niche space
for *Planktothrix* sp. and Microcystis sp., the dominate species
in summer. In insolation-TN plane, the orbit of aquatic
environment cross over the niche space of *Planktothrix* and
Microcystis chronologically in Miyun Reservoir. In addition, the
growth potential of the odor-producing *Planktothrix* sp. will
probably increase after the water from Danjiangkou Reservoir 􏰀low
into Miyun Reservoir according to the simulation result. This
study is helpful for the understanding of algal competition and
succession based on the ecological niche theory, and can provide
an important tool to assess the risk of T&O problem therefore
conducting the source water management.


## Regulation and control of *Planktothrix* sp.

The control and management of harmful algae bloom in source water
is critical to drinking water safety, especially for the algal
toxins and taste & odor issues. Due to traditional solutions of
controlling algae were mainly based on physical or chemical
mechanisms, they were greatly limited by their disadvantages
including high energy consuming or toxic to other aquatic
organisms. According the previous result, the niche space of
*Planktothrix* sp. has been determined, and the key factors
governing its growth were identified as the light availability
and nutrient concentration in water. It implies the water depth
is a comprehensive factor: low water depth have high risk.
According to this result, the high risk zone of suffering T&O
problem has been determined. By performing the GIS based
technology, the dynamic changes of high risk zone were simulated
under different water level, and the recommend water level of
Miyun Reservoir were determined aiming to minimize the T&O risk.
The result showed that the risk (less than 10 %) of suffering T&O
problem can be signi􏰀icant reduced if the water level rising to
147.7 m a.s.l. in Miyun Reservoir. In addition, the application
of water level strategy were discussed for different types of
reservoirs/lakes. This strategy can be applied combined with the
South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and could be a possible
solution for the T&O problem in Miyun Reservoir.
