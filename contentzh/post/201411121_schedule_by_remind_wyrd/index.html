<h2>How do you schedule your time?</h2>
<p>I was using <strong><a href="https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli">gcalcli</a></strong> for
couple years, however, it is become very difficult to use in
mainland China, due to the <strong>GFW</strong> policy; on the other hand, I
prefer to using my own server other than using the server from
others, in this case <strong>google calendar</strong>.</p>
<p>So I start to find a better solution. Fortunately, I managed it
by using
<strong><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind">remind</a></strong>,
<strong><a href="http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/">wyrd</a></strong>,
<strong><a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">conky</a></strong> and
<strong><a href="https://github.com/SwissKid/rem2html">rem2html</a></strong>.</p>

<h2>remind</h2>
<p>Plain text is the most portable, munge-able, searchable,
dependable, and software-agnostic file format there is. We’ve
covered how to track your tasks and projects in a todo.txt file;
today we’re going to extend our plain text personal information
manager to include a full-on calendar, using an old school UNIX
program called
<strong><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind">Remind</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind">Remind</a></strong> is
really a powerful tool to schedule your time.
I am not going to the detail for the usage of
<strong><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind">Remind</a></strong>, you
might go to the shell, and type:</p>
<pre><code>$man remind</code></pre>
<p>For example, you can shedule a date with your GF/BF like this:</p>
<pre><code>REM 2014/12/24 MSG Dating this evening with honey.</code></pre>
<p>Or you can check your salary on the first day of each month:</p>
<pre><code>REM 1 MSG Checking salary.</code></pre>
<p>Or have a meething:</p>
<pre><code>REM 2014/11/25 AT 9:00 MSG Meeting now</code></pre>

<div id="wyrd" class="section level2">

<p><strong><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind">Remind</a></strong> is
very powerful but not handy enough, as you have to remeber lots
of commands. If you use it in a very simple way, just like
me,
<strong><a href="http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/">wyrd</a></strong> is a good
choice.</p>
<p>Speaking of regularly using -
<strong><a href="http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/">wyrd</a></strong>
will be used just as much as
<strong><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind">Remind</a></strong>. In
addition to the easy to navigate display of events it
also has a fully-configurable set of hotkeys that, for the
little that I’ve used them, seem to work a lot like Vim. There
happen to be two things that I like best about
<strong><a href="http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/">wyrd</a></strong>
right from the start. The first is the fact that it’s written in
OCaml. The second is that the developer took the time to make a
well-orchestrated SWF file that walks through some sample uses.
It just warms my little heart to see a developer caring about
their users. ;-)</p>
<p>For me, the most fantastic usage of
<strong><a href="http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/">wyrd</a></strong> is its
quick_event function, similar to
<strong><a href="https://github.com/insanum/gcalcli">gcalcli</a></strong>.</p>
<p>You could use it in a smart way, like this:</p>
<pre><code>wyrd --add &#39;Have dinner with John Fri 6pm.&#39;
wyrd --add &#39;Tomorrow 7:30am prepare breakfast.&#39;</code></pre>
<p>and also there are a lot more handy short cut for using
<strong><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind">Remind</a></strong>
by
<strong><a href="http://pessimization.com/software/wyrd/">wyrd</a></strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="conky" class="section level2">
<h2>conky</h2>
<p>You can also add such line in your <strong>conkyrc</strong> script, then you
will get a week scale schedule calendar on your desktop.</p>
<pre><code>${execi 300 remind -c+1 -n ~/.reminders}</code></pre>
<p>In addition, you can get a schedule summary in text style by
adding this line to your <strong>conkyrc</strong> file:</p>
<pre><code>${execi 300 remind -n ~/.reminders | sort}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="rem2html" class="section level2">
<h2>rem2html</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you might want to public your calendar on your blog,
you can use
<strong><a href="https://github.com/SwissKid/rem2html">rem2html</a></strong> for
generating a static web calendar.</p>
<p>You can have a look at mine via:
<a href="/cal/">My calendar</a></p>
<p>Usage:</p>
<pre><code>remind -ps12 /home/ming/.reminders | sed &#39;s/^\(.*:.*:.*m\) .*$/\1 BUSY/g&#39; | /home/ming/bin/rem2html --title &quot;ming&#39;s calendar&quot;&gt; /var/www/cal/index.html</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>sed</strong> command here is aiming to replace your schedule
detail to <strong>BUSY</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>-ps12</strong> means you will publish the following 12 month calendar
to the web page.</p>

<h3><em>text message</em> to your cell phone</h3>
<p>You might able to find some particular method to send text
message from shell to your cell phone.</p>
<p>Here are some hint:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/sms-using-email/">How to Send SMS Using Email to Major US Cellphone
Carriers</a></li>
<li>if you are a china telecom user, you can use their free
service indirectly:
i setup your china telecom email address;
i setup the email system text to you in its setup;
i send a reminder email to your china telecom email
address by using <strong><a href="http://www.mutt.org">mutt</a></strong>, then

<div id="email-and-desktop-reminder" class="section level3">
<h3>email and desktop reminder</h3>
<p>You can also send email to you for remindering, I believe there
are many ways to do this. In my case, I using
<strong><a href="http://www.mutt.org">mutt</a></strong> for email.</p>
<p>The basic usage of <strong><a href="http://www.mutt.org">mutt</a></strong>:</p>
<pre><code>echo email body | mutt -s subject send-to-email-address</code></pre>
<p>Combined with
<strong><a href="http://www.roaringpenguin.com/products/remind">remind</a></strong></p>
<p>You might also want to get a desktop reminder by <strong>gxmessage</strong>,
you can install it by (debian like system):</p>
<pre><code>apt-get install gxmessage</code></pre>
<p>And you can start <strong>remind</strong> server and enable both <strong>gxmessage</strong>
reminder and <strong>mail</strong> reminder by using:</p>
<pre><code>$remind -z -k&#39;gxmessage -title &quot;reminder&quot; -center %s &amp;&amp; echo %s | mutt -s %s YOUREMAILADRESSn &amp;&#39; ~/.reminders &amp;</code></pre>
<p>You can also add this to your <strong>.xinitrc</strong> file.</p>
