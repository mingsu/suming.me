Inspired by 

> Don't let your tear be the last drop of water in the world

I designed my peasonal logo.

<img src="/post/logo.png" alt="Ming's logo">
<fc>My peasonal logo</fc>

This logo is basically composed of two drop tears and one drop
water. The water-drop in the left side means the last drop water
in the world, but also it means all bios in the planet  share the
same drop of water.

**SAVE WATER, SAVE OURSELF.**

---------

The water-drops in the right side are the tears reflecting the
sadness of human-beings.

**STOP POLLUTING, STOP KILLING OUR CHILDREN**

---------

As it is my peasonal logo, these three drops draw the outline of
my name: Ming Su.

The gap between the left drop and middle drop is "S", and the
drops of tear are "M".
